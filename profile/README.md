# H II Turbulence

Umbrella organization for projects related to:

1. (Magneto)hydrodynamical Turbulence in H II regions
2. Dynamics and kinematics of H II regions more generally
3. (Aspirationally) dynamic and kinematics of neutral/molecular gas around H II regions

## Projects

- [turb-t2-paper](https://github.com/will-henney/turb-t2-paper) Pair of papers in preparation on the contribution of internal turbulence to temperature fluctuations in H II regions
- [mariano-velocity-statistics](https://github.com/will-henney/mariano-velocity-statistics) Lots of historical material from 2019 to 2022, including early notes on material that ended up in Javier's thesis
